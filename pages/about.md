# It Started with an Idea

Leads are the heart and soul of your business. Sales from customers of all relationship cycles are part and parcel with your growth, scalability, and ultimately your company thriving. However, lead quantity and quality are often the most overlooked facets of sales performance. Sales leaders are quick to evaluate their salesforce without evaluating the prospects that their sales team are soliciting.

Enter West Creek Enterprise. John Sokol has over 3 years experience in lead generation expertise developing cutting-edge, innovative data science solutions applicable to your sales domain. The centerpiece of West Creek Enteprise's offerings is the Lead Generation Platform, a tool that extracts key vendor and decision maker contact information and arms your sales team for reduced time to penetrate to each prospect, stronger relationships, and more generated revenue.

West Creek Enterprise also offers data enrichment services for existing leads in your database, and lead scoring consultation services.
Reach out at john@westcreekenteprise.com or call John directly at 609-290-9340 for an introductory call.

# Pricing

Pricing is structured on an ad-hoc pay-per-lead or contract basis, with flexible terms that fit your business needs. An introductory call with an evaluation of your leads structure is a first step, followed by a statement of work proposal which contains pricing details that outline the services and offerings that are aligned to solve your business problems.
