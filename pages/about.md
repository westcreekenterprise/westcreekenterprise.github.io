# It Started with an Idea

The leads in your database are the heart and soul of your business, reliant upon sales from customers of all relationship cycles to grow, scale and ultimately thrive. However, lead quantity and quality are often the most overlooked facets of sales performance. Sales leaders are quick to evaluate their salesforce without evaluating the prospects their sales team are soliciting. This is frequently attributed to lack of resources allocated towards lead generation and quality.

Enter West Creek Enterprise. Founder and Owner John Sokol has over 3 years experience in lead generation expertise developing cutting-edge, innovative data science solutions to drive sales success. The centerpiece of West Creek Enteprise's offerings is the Lead Generation Platform, a tool that extracts information imperative to sales solicitation efforts from numerous sources, and packages it to you to arm your sales team for reduced time to penetrate to the account, stronger relationships, and more revenue generated.

In addition, West Creek Enterprise offers data append services for existing leads in your database, and lead quality assessment consultation services.

# Pricing

Pricing is structured on an ad-hoc pay-per-lead or contract basis, with flexible terms that fit your business needs. An introductory call with an evaluation of your leads structure is a first step, followed by a statement of work proposal which contains pricing details that outline the services and offerings that are aligned to solve your business problems.
